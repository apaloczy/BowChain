Consider the case of a vertical chain with no clock offsets between
instruments. At any given time /t/, we directly sample a vertical slice of the
temperature field at position /x(t)/:

Introducing random clock offsets makes it appear that the instruments are not
aligned horizontally:

Shifting sensor signals in time to maximize correlation between signals from
adjacent sensors reconstructs a vertical slice beneath the ship at any given time.
